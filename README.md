# fMRI-to-Image-Reconstruction
Implementation for Proof of Concept

Experiment Objective

Identify which brain ROI’s fMRI responses align most strongly with different modality embeddings (e.g., image, text, multimodal).

Why: By comparing alignment strength, we can infer the predominant information each ROI encodes—e.g., low-level visual features, mid-level shape/texture, or high-level semantic content—thereby mapping ROIs to their most relevant representational level.
